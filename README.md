# rpg scripts

## Scope

I can never get the _inital_ build/creation of something in an RPG put together. These are some simple
scripts to help me in my RPG(ing). Everything should output to markdown, and hopfully will help
you too.

If you've found these scripts, I really hope they help you out, and PRs and suggestions are always welcome.

## Setup

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
